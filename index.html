<h3 id="wel">Welcome to my page!</h1>

<p>Hello there!, I am Amjad Mesmar, I am a Jordanian 29 year old programmer,
ever since I was a kid, video games were my passion, which lead me to love 
programming and peruse getting a bachelor degree in computer science, which I did. <br>
There is nothing that makes me happier than seeing my code actually working and being
in action, I still can't believe that once in my life i thought that programming is
impossible for me to learn, but here I am a decade later made some basic applications,
websites, and even some simple video games on Unity3D! <br>
My love for coding lead me to love doing 3D modeling using blender as well,
I always find learning new skills challenging and fun.</p> <br>
